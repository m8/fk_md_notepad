**DON'T USE MARKDOWN NOTEPADS!!!**, it's just a waste of time to find a good markdown notebook. don't use some kind of fancy editors to take a bunch of notes. stick with a technology you know. i tried a lot of different markdown editors for linux but i couldn't satisfied at all.

So use **VSCODE** !
